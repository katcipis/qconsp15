# Microservices under the microscope

This presentation was centered around the idea that APIs must be handled
as a product, where the development team is the product owner.

There was also a lot of talk about how APIs must come first and you must
think outside in when specifying it.

A lot of [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) bells ringed on my head :-).

There was also the usual talk about the need of automation on testing and deployment.

On the end there was two concepts that I found pretty cool:

    * Design APIs as if they where public, even if they are private
    * Trust the services provided by other teams
